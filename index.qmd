title: "Learn Hugging Face ü§ó (work in progress)"
---

Website dedicated to teaching the Hugging Face ecosystem with practical examples.

Each example will include an end-to-end approach of starting with a dataset (custom or existing), building and evaluating a model and creating a demo to share.

Teaching style: 

A machine learning cooking show! üë®‚Äçüç≥

Mottos:

* ***If in doubt, run the code.*** -- Machine learning is very experimental. So it's good to get in the habit of continually trying things (even if you think they won't work).
* ***Visualize, visualize, visualize!*** - If you're not sure of some dataset or some operation or some predictions, visualize it/them.
* ***Experiment, experiment, experiment!*** - Again, machine learning is very experimental. So keep trying different things!
* ***Data, model, demo!*** - Create/get a dataset, build/train/evaluate a model, create a demo to share.

Project style:

Data, model, demo!

* Create a new/reuse an existing dataset.
* Train/evaluate a model.
* Build a demo to share.

This will be our (rough) workflow:

     alt="The diagram shows the Hugging Face model development workflow, which includes the following steps: start with an idea or problem, get data ready (turn into tensors/create data splits), pick a pretrained model (to suit your problem), train/fine-tune the model on your custom data, evaluate the model, improve through experimentation, save and upload the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub, and turn your model into a shareable demo. Tools used in this workflow are Datasets/Tokenizers, Transformers/PEFT/Accelerate/timm, Hub/Spaces/Gradio, and Evaluate."

These kind of workflows are not set in stone and are more of guide than specific directions.

| Project | Description | Dataset | Model | Demo |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Text classification](https://www.learnhuggingface.com/notebooks/hugging_face_text_classification_tutorial) (good place to start) | Build project "Food Not Food", a text classification model to classify image captions into "food" if they're about food or "not_food" if they're not about food. This is the ideal place to get started if you've never used the Hugging Face ecosystem. | [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_image_captions) | [Model](https://huggingface.co/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_demo) |

## Who is it for?

Ideal for:

* Beginners who love things explained in detail.
* Someone who wants to create more of their own end-to-end machine learning projects.

Not ideal for:

* People with 2-3+ years of machine learning projects & experience^.

^Note: This being said, you may actually find some things helpful along the way. Best to explore and see!

## Prerequisites

* 3-6 months Python experience.
* 1x beginner machine learning or deep learning course (see my [begineer-friendly ML course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse) to learn Python + important ML concepts in one).
    * PyTorch experience is a bonus (see my [Learn PyTorch in a Day video](https://youtu.be/Z_ikDlimN6A?si=Glf8q383cV0P9hEO) or [learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/))

## What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is a platform that offers access to many different kinds of open-source machine learning models and datasets.

They're also the creators of the popular [`transformers` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) (and many more helpful libraries) which is a Python-based library for working with pre-trained models as well as custom models.

If you're getting into the world of AI and machine learning, you're going to come across Hugging Face.

## Why Hugging Face?

Many of the biggest companies in the world use Hugging Face for their open-source machine learning projects including [Apple](https://huggingface.co/apple), [Google](https://huggingface.co/google), [Facebook](https://huggingface.co/facebook) (Meta), [Microsoft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft), [OpenAI](https://huggingface.co/openai), [ByteDance](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance) and more.

Not only does Hugging Face make it so you can use state-of-the-art machine learning models such as [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) (for image generation) and [Whipser](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) (for audio transcription) easily, it also makes it so you can share your own models, datasets and resources.

Aside from your own website, consider Hugging Face the homepage of your AI/machine learning profile.

## TODO

* [ ] Finish outline of this (index.md) page
   * [ ] Copy a similar version to the README.md for GitHub
   * [ ] Make share image for the whole thing 
* [ ] Make index of different projects
* [ ] Ecosystem overview: transformers, datasets, accelerate, Spaces, Hub, models etc
* [ ] Practical tutorials
    * [ ] Text classification (this will be like a "start here" for the Hugging Face ecosystem)
    * [ ] More to come...
* [ ] Where to get help? HF forums, HF GitHub, etc
* [ ] Finish setup page
   * [ ] Local setup
* [x] Finish deployment to learnhuggingface.com page
* [ ] Get started: text classification shows an end-to-end workflow with detailed steps, I'd advise starting here to get to know the ecosystem a bit
    * [ ] Other projects are more focused on specific tasks with less explanations but still complete code examples 

## FAQ

> Is this an official Hugging Face website?

No, it's a personal project by myself ([Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com)) to learn and help others learn the Hugging Face ecosystem.

> How is this website made?

This is a Quarto website.
