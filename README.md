# Learn Hugging Face ðŸ¤— (work in progress)

I'd like to learn the Hugging Face ecosystem better (transformers, datasets, accelerate + more).

So this repo is to  help me learn it and simulatenously teach others.

Think of it as a small version of the [Hugging Face cookbook](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook) with a series of practical examples and tutorials.

Repo outline:
- Most of the materials will be in the form of runnable Jupyter notebooks with explanations + code snippets you can run for yourself.
- For high-level concepts, there will be a few text-based tutorials.
- But most of it will focus on practical examples.
- All will come in a nicely formatted online book/documentation website.

## TODO
- [ ] Ecosystem overview (transformers, datasets, accelerate, tokenizers, Spaces, demos, models, hub etc.)
- [ ] Text classification
- [ ] Named entity recognition
- [ ] LLM fine-tuning
- [ ] RAG workflow
- [ ] Zero-shot image classification/multi-modal workflows (CLIP)
- [ ] Object detection

## Setup

Notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab but can also work locally.

TODO: Add setup instructions
