# Learn Hugging Face ðŸ¤— (work in progress)

Repo designed to help learn the Hugging Face ecosystem (transformers, datasets, accelerate + more).

Think of it as a small Hugging Face cookbook with a series of practical examples and tutorials.

Repo outline:
- Most of the materials will be in the form of runnable Jupyter notebooks with explanations + code snippets you can run for yourself.
- For high-level concepts, there will be a few text-based tutorials.
- But most of it will focus on practical examples.
- All will come in a nicely formatted online book/documentation website.

## TODO

## Setup

Notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab but can also work locally.
