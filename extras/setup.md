We'll need to install the following libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem:

* [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/installation) - comes pre-installed on Google Colab but if you're running on your local machine, you can install it via `pip install transformers`.
* [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation) - a library for accessing and manipulating datasets on and off the Hugging Face Hub, you can install it via `pip install datasets`.
* [`evaluate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/installation) - a library for evaluating machine learning model performance with various metrics, you can install it via `pip install evaluate`.
* [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/basic_tutorials/install) - a library for training machine learning models faster, you can install it via `pip install accelerate`.
* [`gradio`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart#installation) - a library for creating interactive demos of machine learning models, you can install it via `pip install gradio`.
