* [ ] Add "getting setup" file to get started locally with the required dependencies
* [ ] Add text classification dataset creation notebook (so people can see where the data comes from)
* [ ] Add a Hugging Face ecosystem overview (transformers, datasets, tokenizers, torch, Hugging Face Hub, Hugging Face Spaces, etc.)
* [ ] Add a fav icon
